- Create an HTML file with a `select` component and fill it with random menu items.
- Create another `textbox` in the same file.
- Now, changing a value in the selectbox should update the value in the `textbox`.

- For ex: If the `select` menu has the items `One`, `Two`, `Three` etc.. Selecting one of those values should make the content of the `textbox` to change to that value

### Rules:

- Use only HTML5
- No external JavaScript libraries should be used.
- The default text on the `select` menu and the `textbox` should be blank.
