var intVal = 10
var strVal = "10"

Comparison is possible. Two ways of comparison are:

* ==  The double equals operator tries to convert values of different types, before comparing like strict equality. 
  The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. 
* ===  The stric equality operator only considers values equal that have the same type.
